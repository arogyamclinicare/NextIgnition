## Environment Variables Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://nextignition.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional: Error Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
```

### Development Setup
For local development, create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```bash
# Copy this to .env.local and update with your values
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ubaudenvfrspjqfbllyn.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InViYXVkZW52ZnJzcGpxZmJsbHluIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTc1NjY3MzAsImV4cCI6MjA3MzE0MjczMH0.tdR1VX8mNEIMwtFgL1-mt1ubRlKNOq9RdvDrKvoAltw
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Note**: The application includes fallback values for development, so it will work even without a `.env.local` file, but it's recommended to create one for proper configuration.

### Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add the following variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (optional)

## GitHub Secrets Setup

### Required Secrets for CI/CD
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - `SNYK_TOKEN` (optional, for security scanning)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Deployment
The CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
- Run linting and type checking
- Execute tests with coverage
- Perform security audits
- Build the application
- Deploy to Vercel (on main branch)

### 3. Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Security Checks
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working
- [ ] Check security headers are present
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is active

### 2. Performance Checks
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit
- [ ] Check Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Verify bundle size optimization
- [ ] Test service worker functionality

### 3. Functionality Checks
- [ ] Test form submissions
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Check accessibility features
- [ ] Test PWA installation

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Verify Sentry error tracking
- [ ] Check analytics integration
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

## Production Monitoring

### Error Tracking
- Sentry is configured for error tracking
- Check Sentry dashboard for any errors
- Set up alerts for critical errors

### Performance Monitoring
- Vercel Analytics is enabled
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Set up performance budgets

### Security Monitoring
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- Monitor for dependency vulnerabilities
- Set up security alerts

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Run security audits weekly
- [ ] Monitor error rates daily
- [ ] Check performance metrics weekly

### Backup Strategy
- Database backups (handled by Supabase)
- Code backups (handled by Git)
- Environment variable backups (stored securely)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check environment variables
2. **Runtime Errors**: Check Sentry dashboard
3. **Performance Issues**: Run Lighthouse audit
4. **Security Issues**: Run `npm audit`

### Support
- Check GitHub Issues for known problems
- Review Vercel deployment logs
- Monitor Sentry for error patterns

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Supabase handles data encryption at rest
- No sensitive data stored in client-side code

### Access Control
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Compliance
- GDPR compliant data handling
- No personal data stored unnecessarily
- User consent for data collection

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting implemented
- Tree shaking enabled
- Image optimization active
- Service worker for caching

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached for 1 year
- API responses cached appropriately
- Service worker for offline support

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management

### Testing
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
- Manual testing with screen readers
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
